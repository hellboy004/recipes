Ingredients
Elbow Pasta (Macaroni Pasta) – 2 cups (app. ½ lb)
Bread Crumbs – 3-4 tbsp
Parmesan Cheese – 2 tbsp
For The Sauce
Butter – 3 tbsp
All Purpose Flour – 3 tbsp
Milk – 2 cups
Salt – ½ tsp
Black Pepper Powder – 1/4 tsp
Cheddar Cheese – 3/4 cup
Mozzarella Cheese – 1/4 cup
Parmesan Cheese – 2 tbsp
Method
Heat a pan over medium low heat and add the butter. Once it melts, add the flour. Mix it and cook it for about a minute.
Add the milk little by little while constantly stirring till you get a nice sauce. Add salt and pepper and switch off.
Add the grated cheese and cover the pan. The heat of the sauce will melt the cheese.
In the meantime, cook the pasta as per the package instructions. Take a deep big pot with plenty of water and bring it to a boil. Add salt and the pasta. Cook till the pasta turns soft but not mushy. Drain the water and add it to the sauce.
Mix the pasta with the sauce till the sauce coats it nicely. You can serve the mac and cheese as such or go ahead and bake it. I often serve it at this stage and it is still delicious. Baking takes it to a whole new level.
